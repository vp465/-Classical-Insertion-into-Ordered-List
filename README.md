###Insertion-into-Ordered-List
## Overview
This project implements classical and quantum algorithms for inserting an item into an ordered list while maintaining its sorted order. The classical implementation is written in Python, while the quantum implementation is written in Q# (Microsoft's quantum programming language).

## Algorithms

### Classical Algorithm
The classical algorithm performs the insertion operation using traditional programming techniques. It finds the appropriate insertion position in the ordered list and shifts existing elements to make space for the new item.

### Quantum Algorithm
The quantum algorithm leverages quantum principles such as superposition and entanglement to achieve efficiency gains in the insertion operation. It manipulates the quantum state representing the ordered list to determine the optimal insertion position and performs the insertion accordingly.
